## My Projects:

- [A Global Perspective: Factors Influencing Life Expectancy (SQL & Python)](https://github.com/kjuliaaustin/project1): This project explores the complex interplay of various factors impacting life expectancy across countries and continents. Through an in-depth analysis of GDP, schooling, mental health, illnesses, and other key determinants, this study sheds light on the diverse range of influences on life expectancy worldwide. By examining these factors at both the country and continental levels, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of life expectancy disparities and the implications for global health policy and practice.
- [Unlocking Home Sale Secrets: Predicting Prices with Python](https://github.com/kjuliaaustin/financial_planning_project): This project leverages Python's powerful data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, to predict home sale prices based on historical data. Using a dataset comprising key property features like square footage, location, and amenities, the project employs machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to build predictive models. Through extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the aim is to provide accurate insights into real estate market trends and assist stakeholders in making informed decisions. This project showcases my proficiency in data science, Python programming, and machine learning techniques applied to real-world datasets.
- [Exploring the Economics of Movie Genres: A Data Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/kjuliaaustin/movie_genres): This project delves into the intricate economics of movie genres, using a data-driven approach to uncover insights that illuminate the film industry's dynamics. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 movies, key metrics such as budget, revenue, profit, popularity, and voting average are examined across different genres. The research seeks to answer fundamental questions about which genres are the most prolific, which ones yield the highest returns, and which factors contribute to a movie's success. Additionally, hypotheses regarding the correlation between critical acclaim, popularity, and financial performance are tested, providing valuable insights for filmmakers, producers, and investors in understanding the nuances of genre-specific movie economics.
- [Unveiling Customer Behavior: A Data Journey in Food Marketing](https://github.com/kjuliaaustin/ufood_marketing): This Python project dives into the intriguing world of customer behavior in a food marketing campaign. Through meticulous data cleaning and transformation, it uncovers fascinating insights about how different factors influence customer responses. Discoveries include surprising trends in customer age, purchasing habits, and more, providing valuable insights for future marketing strategies.
- [Financial Insights: A Dynamic Dashboard for Expense Analysis](https://github.com/kjuliaaustin/expenses_tracker): Built using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries, this tool transforms raw expense data into a visual feast, categorizing spending habits and unveiling trends over time.
